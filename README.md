JeromEssentials

JeromEssentials are a series of program applications that is necessary to my 
daily life, such as a shopping list, reminders app, and a calendar.

This application is made to help me with my day-to-day life. As an individual
who is always bad at remembering many things, this app will help me to remember
anything I need, from any device. I tend to forget important due dates and 
important events such as an oil change and birthdays. I have created a shopping
list, and will soon create a reminders app and a calendar. I have chose to do
it on a website rather than an application for ease of access. 

The packages it uses is ReactJS so far. I will also soon implement this on AWS.
The challenging part of this project so far would have definitely been the formatting,
which is done on CSS. I couldn't get the outlines to look nice, and the input box
and page title within the outlined box I made. I was also having issues getting
Font Awesome Icons to work, so I have made an alternative and just delete 
some shopping items by just clicking on the icons itself.
